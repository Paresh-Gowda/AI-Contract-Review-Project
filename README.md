# ðŸ¤– AI Contract Review Project

AI Contract Review Project is an intelligent platform designed to simplify and automate the process of reviewing legal contracts.
It helps users quickly understand lengthy contracts by highlighting key clauses, obligations, and potential risks, making contract management faster, safer, and more efficient.

The system uses the OpenAI API to process PDF and DOCX files, generating concise summaries of contracts.
It not only extracts important information but also provides reference source links to ensure transparency and reliability.
This allows users to verify key clauses and access context directly from the original documents.

The project is built using a modern tech stack. The frontend is developed with React and Node.js, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface.
Backend data is handled using JSON, while CSS is used to create a clean and intuitive design for the UI/UX.
SQL is employed for database management, and OpenAI API keys enable the AI-driven contract analysis and summarization.

AI Contract Review Project is more than just a tool â€” itâ€™s a step toward smarter, AI-assisted contract management.
By combining advanced AI processing with a user-friendly interface and reliable data handling, the platform empowers professionals to save time, reduce errors, and make confident decisions in legal document analysis.
